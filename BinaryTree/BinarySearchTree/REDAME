BTS: binary search Tree
左子树的节点小于当前节点的值，右子树的节点大于当前节点的值
从BST中删除一个元素：
boolean delete(E e) {
  locate element e in the tree
  if element e is not found:
    return false;
  Let current be the node that contain element e and parent be the parent of current:
  if(current has no left child)
    connect the right child of current with parent, now current is not referenced, so it is eliminated
  else   //
    locate the rightmost node in the left subtree of current
    copy the element value in the rightmost node to current
    connect the parent of the rightmost to the left child of rightmost
  return true
}
